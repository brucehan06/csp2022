    <h1>   This codeing project by me and my partner shows a landscape image of a few penguins playing hide and seek.</h1>
    <h1>   There are constant falling snow from the cloud in a loop.</h1>
    <h1>   There are also a few background features, such as a ice pond, or a mountain.</h1>

    <h1>   In this game, Pumpkin Clicker 101, there will be pumpkins falling from the sky that you would have to click to recieve 1 point </h1>
    <h1>   we coded it so that if you miss a pumpkin, you will be deducted a point. In our code, there is a 1/5 chance that a pumpkin </h1>
    <h1>   would spawn as a bomb, clicking that would recieve a penalty of 5 points. Our game takes reaction time, percision, and speed. </h1>

    <h1>   In this codeing project, we created a E-card for the childrens hospital.</h1>
    <h1>   It begins with a big red button, and we all know kids love to press big red buttons.</h1>
    <h1>   Then, a well known super hero flys in with inspirational music in the background.</h1>
    <h1>   He starts to tell the kid some inspirational messages, like you are strong or get well.</h1>
    <h1>   Once hes done telling the kid he is strong, he tells him his farewells and flys away.</h1>

    <h1>   This is the revolutionary game called REVERSE PONG. We took the 1v1 pong game and made it into a team work and collaboration game.</h1>
    <h1>   Our game helps with hand eye cordination and communcation with your partners. We also promote healthy eating and exercising.</h1>
    <h1>   By moving ur character up and down trying to catch the Fruit Platter.</h1>
    <h1>   Using the W and S key for left player and the arrow keys for right. you will be able to control your character's movements.</h1>
    <h1>   The scoring would be calcutated for the total points both players collect because we promote collaboration and team work.</h1>

    <h1>   Our data matches the data with the Inland Forest the most.</h1>
    <h1>   The data of sound matches perfectly since it shows constant noise at 75 hz and inland forest has constant howl of wind.</h1>
    <h1>   The data of the temperature matches as well, since our data shows smooth constant data, that goes from constant low to constant high.</h1>
    <h1>   The data of the light matches the low ambient light as well.</h1>
    <h1>   The data of the gyroscope also matches the little to no wind as there isnt alot of spikes.</h1>
    <h1>   With all the data we recieved from the rover, our final conclution is that its location is the Inland Forest.</h1>

    <h1>   Me and my partner analyzed the honeycomb complex simulation on Netlogo.</h1>
    <h1>   The model simulates the speed and patterns of how bees create honeycomb, and how the number of bees affect the production.</h1>
    <h1>   Although the simulation were lacking in information in a few places such as hw the geographical location affects the bees.</h1>
    <h1>   Or how the change in weather, enviorment or predators affect the productions of the bees.</h1>
    <h1>   The simulation still works well with the turtles being the bees and the patches being the honeycombs.</h1>
    <h1>  And the simulation still shows us the patterns of how bees move to create the honeycombs, and the number of bees affecting the honeycomb production.</h1>
